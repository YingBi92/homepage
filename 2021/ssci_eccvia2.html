<h3><font color="#0000FF">Aim and Scope:</font></h3> 
<p>  

<b>Computer vision</b> is a big research field that studies to use computers process, extract, analyse and understand information from digital images and videos as the human vision system does. It covers a wide range of applications in many important fields, including engineering, biology, medicine, remote sensing, and business. Furthermore, many computer vision tasks are highly related to our daily life, from face detection in the mobile phone to self-driving vehicles. Typical tasks related to computer vision and image analysis include image processing, edge detection, image classification, image segmentation, object detection, scene analysis, biological identification, motion analysis, and image restoration. These tasks have not been comprehensively solved, particularly in the era of big data, when image data are easy to obtained but may be more challenging to analyse. It is necessary to develop new effective and efficient methods to solve the tasks in computer vision. 
<p>
<b>Evolutionary computation</b> is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that includes a family of nature-inspired population-based algorithms/techniques. Evolutionary computation techniques have promising global search/optimization ability to find high-quality solutions to complex problems without requiring rich domain knowledge. Existing evolutionary computation paradigms include Genetic algorithms (GAs), Genetic programming (GP), Evolutionary programming (EP), Evolution strategies (ES), Learning classifier systems (LCS), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Ant colony optimization (ACO), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) and Memetic Computing (MC). Evolutionary computation techniques have been successfully applied to solve many computer vision and image analysis tasks, including image classification, image segmentation, object recognition, and image registration. However, the potential of evolutionary computation has not been comprehensively investigated in computer vision and image analysis. The challenges of improving effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability, and reducing the requirement of domain knowledge and human intervention are urging to be addressed by investigating new evolutionary computation approaches to computer vision and image analysis. 
</p>
This special session aims to investigate the use of evolutionary computation for computer vision and image analysis, covering ALL different evolutionary computation paradigms and their applications to computer vision and image analysis. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from around the world to discuss the latest advances in the field and will act as a major forum for the presentation of recent research. Authors are invited to submit their original and unpublished work to this special session. Topics related to all aspects of evolutionary computation for computer vision and image analysis, such as theories, algorithms, systems and applications, are welcome. </p>
